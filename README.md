# command-line rust

Some small CLIs written in Rust. I'm in the process of updating to Clap v4 and using Derive. This repository is a work-in-progress.


## 1-hello
Simple, Hello World. No clap needed.

## 2-echor
Implementation of echo in Rust. Updated to derive.

## 3-catr
Implementation of cat in Rust. Updated to derive.

## 4-headr
Implementation of head in Rust. Updated to derive.

## 5-wcr
Implementation of wc in Rust.

## 6-uniqr
Implementation of uniq in Rust.

## 7-findr
Implementation of find in Rust.

## 8-cutr
Implementation of cut in Rust. Unfortunately, when I moved from submodules to monorepo I misplaced some of the code. I'm rewriting from scratch for derive, so no great loss.

## 9-grepr
Implementation of grep in Rust. Ripgrep this is not. In-Progress.
